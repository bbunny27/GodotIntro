### I want to learn how to make games. 

I am following this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0&t=830s"> Godot game making tutorial </a>.<br>
All Credit goes to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Brackeys">Brackey's</a> on Youtube. <br>
While my game is not identical to his, I am very obviously following his instructions generally and using his free asset pack on the video.
